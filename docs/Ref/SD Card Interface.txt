CS - Chip Select (0 for SPI mode)
MOSI - Master Out, Slave In (Write to)
MISO - Master In, Slave Out (Read from)
SCK - Serial Clock
CD - Card Detection
WP - Write Protection

>> To Write

1. Set MOSI and CS lines to 1, toggle CLK for at least 74 cycles.
2. Set CS to 0, and send "01 000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 1001010 1".
3. If successful, will receive "0000 0001". To receive, keep MOSI=1 and CS=0 while toggling CLK, look for data.
  MISO line is kept high while SD sends no data.
  Format: 0, param error, address error, case seq error, crc error, illegal cmd, erase reset, in idle state
